When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to use GitHub to manage your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Might confuse things - especially if collaborating with others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks - make a copy on GitHub of another repository (someone else’s) also on GitHub
    Clone - copy of a repository. GitHub to Local, or local to local. To get a forked repository on your computer - first fork it so it’s on your gitHub, then clone to your computer.
    Branch - within same repository


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can work offline with latest contributions on remote repository. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

	Email/dropbox/google drive files to each other. 
       Con: Need to record and communicate about changes. 
	Pro: More intuitive than learning git commands and gitHub platform  

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
